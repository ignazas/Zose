2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net btn_f_down_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): btn_f_down_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_24586_zose_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_24586_zose_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_24586_zose_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_24586_zose_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_24586_zose_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and clk_24586_zose_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_24586_zose_clk_wiz_0_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_24586_zose_clk_wiz_0_0]
